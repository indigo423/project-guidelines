=== Datacenter

This scenario describes a network with multiple data centers.
The order of magnitude for the amount of data center is 10.
Data centers are connected in full mesh and the characteristics of the network connection is defined as the following:

* High Bandwidth: Means there are no considerations for the size of monitoring data
* Low Latency: Roundtrip time for communication is in hundreds of milli seconds.
* Reliable: Network uses redundant protocols are provide fail over capabilities

.Pod
In a data center a _Pod_ is described as a infrastructure assigned to a specific customer.
_Pods_ are isolated for data protection reasons and are associated to a customer.
A _Pods_ in a data center is comparable to a large server room in a company.

.Network Equipment, Application and Database server
In every _Pod_ you can find all the equipment similar to a network of a company.
It should be possible to assign monitored data from this _Pod_ to a customer for security and surveillance context.

== OpenNMS overall architecture

=== Introduction

Goals for the _OpenNMS_ Cluster architecture:

* High Availability: Monitoring systems become an important part in the infrastructure.
  The system part which does monitoring should be high available and resilient.
  Restart or failure of monitoring components should not effecting other monitoring components.
  The system should be distributable to allow a fail over.
* Workload scalable: The amount of data and system which can be monitored require a scalable infrastructure.
  Limitations can be the amount of open connections from a single system for active service monitoring and the time resources are bound during the test.
  Beside availability monitoring there is a large amount of performance data which has to be gathered through several protocols and the persistence.
